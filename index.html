                <h2 id="newsheader1">Will ChatGPT destroy coding ?</h2>
                <p id="news1">
                        If you are a programmer or software engineer, 
                        it is more than likely that you have been fascinated by the capabilities of ChatGPT,
                        the conversational model developed by OpenAI.
                        ChatGPT has become a phenomenon by itself since its release in November 2022 and 
                        its users number in the millions.</br></br>
                        <img id="newsimage1" src="newsimage1.jpg" /></br></br>
                        ChatGPT is based on the GPT-3 language model, which is also proprietary to OpenAI.
                        It has more than 175 million parameters and is trained with a large amount of text, 
                        which gives 
                    <span id="dots">...</span>
                    <span id="newsmore">
                        it great generative abilities.</br>
                        However, one of the most captivating aspects
                        has been its ability to write code. Just tell
                        him what you want him to do and he can build anything
                        from web pages to applications or even games. Some of 
                        the languages that ChatGPT masters are Python, C and Javascript, 
                        widely used in development environments.</br>
                        As is often the case in these cases, there are 
                        those who see this as an excellent support tool thanks
                        to the time savings involved. On the other hand, the more
                        catastrophic ones believe that ChatGPT could “eliminate”
                        the classic figure of the programmer.</br>
                        Contrary to what is happening with imagers and artists, 
                        the more creative writing
                        sector seems to be breathing easy (for the time being). 
                        Novelists, copywriters and journalists have noted that ChatGPT 
                        is not yet at a “worrying” stage.</br>
                        The results that OpenAI’s chatbot
                        produces do not take into account many of the aspects that are key 
                        to good prose: little personality, prone to factual errors and with
                        no apparent objective that manages to convey emotion.</br>
                        It is different with programming. The only thing that matters is
                        that the code works according to what is requested and needed, no more.
                        Effectiveness takes precedence over everything else, something logical 
                        if we take into account that the technical aspect is very important when
                        it comes to programming. </br>
                        Even so, don’t think that ChatGPT is going
                        to reduce engineers and programmers to ashes.To begin with, ChatGPT
                        is only capable of creating very simple programs. In fact, if you
                        ask for something too complex, the chatbot will politely send you
                        off to fry asparagus. Therefore, currently ChatGPT would serve more
                        as an assistant when programming.</br>
                        However, this does not mean that
                        it cannot evolve to offer a better service.So, what can ChatGPT really
                        offer a programmer today? Many industry professionals seem to agree
                        on one thing: it is a very valuable tool. Thanks to ChatGPT, 
                        you could generate frameworks and preview versions of more “complicated”
                        applications. In other words, it could create the basis for faster development times.</br>
                        Artificial intelligence is often talked about with fear and admiration. 
                        Will it create jobs? Will it demolish what we already know? 
                        While ChatGPT will speed up the completion of tasks, 
                        it is a fact that it will also create new needs and jobs. 
                        This includes the much criticized “prompt engineer” or what is the same: 
                        giving instructions to generative models to get the most out of them.</br>
                        If you want to rest easy, at the moment this technology is unlikely 
                        to replace everything you’ve learned about coding and engineering. 
                        Your knowledge is still very necessary, even if you change how you use 
                        it to carry out your work. In the end, all those who are able to take 
                        this technology and use it to their advantage will prosper.

                <h2 id="newsheader1">Is jQuery dead ?</h2>
                <p id="news1">
                        Whether or not jQuery is dead seems to be a
                        hot topic for people in the coding world. 
                        So, I decided to explore it myself. 
                        When I first started learning javascript, 
                        I learned jQuery so when I found out it was
                        on the decline, I was a little surprised.</br></br>
                        <img id="newsimage2" src="newsimage2.jpg" /></br></br>
                        To understand what happened to jQuery, you have
                        to understand what jQuery is. JQuery is a javascript
                        library with many features made for making websites dynamic. 
                        It has event handling, animation, DOM traversal, and more. 
                        What jQuery did when it was first created was make AJAX easier 
                        and allowed people to easily access to      
                    <span id="dots2">...</span>
                    <span id="newsmore2">
                        the DOM to make their pages less static.</br>
                        This sounds like something we do today in Javascript, and that’s because it is. 
                        JQuery is similar to react where it broke down Javascript
                        coding into digestable blocks. What made jQuery special was that it had ways
                        of making the AJAX and event handling much easier for coders before many other
                        libraries did. So, jQuery was early to the game and did something new, which is 
                        what made it so popular.</br>
                        Another thing that made jQuery popular was that other 
                        frameworks and libraries drew from it, one famous example being Bootstrap. 
                        Bootstrap perfectly exemplifies what happened to jQuery as it is dropping 
                        jQuery as a dependency in the new version.</br>
                        JQuery is useful, but what killed it was it’s widespread use. 
                        Vanilla Javascript kept updating so that things that made jQuery 
                        special became things that you found in Javascript without jQuery. 
                        So, it started becoming obsolete. React is a framework that many 
                        use in place of jQuery now because it does the job of organizing 
                        code into workable blocks but also has extra functionality that is 
                        not available in vanilla Javascript. It still has something special about it.</br>
                        As languages update and evolve, certain frameworks and libraries need to be reworked 
                        or left behind because technology moves fast. JQuery is a perfect example 
                        of what happens to a library that does not change enough with the times.</br>
                        So, is jQuery dead? It is still used in things like Wordpress, which means
                        it is still widely used. But it is dying. As other framework and libraries 
                        drop jQuery as a dependency, it will slowly be 
                        used less and less until it is not needed at all.</br>
